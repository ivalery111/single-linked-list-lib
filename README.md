## Single Linked List Library  
This repository is a result of my learning about opaque structures and pointers.
It is a simple implementation of a single linked list. You can use this library in your project as an independent part. The library has a clear API.

## Usage  
Do `make`. After that, you will get the *liblinkedlist.a*. Put the *liblinkedlist.a* with *linkedlist.h* into your project and link the library
